Type: It is a low pressure evaporating type generator, specifically designed for jacket water heating in marine applications. The shell & tube design ensures efficient heat transfer and corrosion resistance.\\n\\n2. Particulars:\\n   - Quantity/Shipment: One (1) set of the FW Generator is included per package.\\n   - Capacity: Each generator has a capacity of 25 tons per day, with an additional 15% fouling margin to account for any potential degradation in performance over time due to contaminants or sediment build-up.\\n   - Shell Vacuum: The generator is designed according to the manufacturer's standard (HYUNDAI-MAN B&W S.W.).\\n   - Salinity of Distillate Water: Maximum permissible salinity level for distilled water output is 10 PPM, ensuring that it meets marine application standards and does not adversely affect the engine or other systems onboard.\\n   - Design Conditions: The generator operates under three primary conditions: heating medium (jacket cooling), main engine's freshwater generator function, and condensing chamber operation.\\n\\n3. Construction & Material:\\n   - Composition: The FW Generator consists of an evaporating chamber, a condensing chamber, distillate pump, salinity indicator, ejector (brine/air), and other necessary accessories.\\n   - Jacket Cooling Water Usage: It utilizes the main engine's jacket cooling water as its heating medium during normal sea operations.\\n   - Eye-plate Specifications: The eye-plates are designed to be suitably fitted for various components, such as rotor of generator, steam turbines, electric motors, heat exchanger covers/tubes/bundles, and heavy strainer covers/filters/elements (approximately 40 kg & above).\\n   - Test Provisions: The package includes provisions for three-way test cocks to be used with pressure switches and pressure transmitters.
